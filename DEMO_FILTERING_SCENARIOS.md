- Linda matches Sarah's criteria ‚Üí Shows pattern recognition
- Others have varied tags ‚Üí Shows filtering actually filters

### 2. **Shows Real Complexity**
- 7 contacts = realistic workload (not trivial, not overwhelming)
- Mix of buyers/sellers = real estate context
- Varied budgets/locations = demonstrates tag diversity

### 3. **Creates "Aha!" Moments**
- **Step 2:** "Only one urgent lead!" ‚Üí Focus
- **Step 3:** "Linda matches Sarah!" ‚Üí Intelligence
- **Bonus demos:** "Look how versatile this is!" ‚Üí Power

### 4. **Enables Storytelling**
- Xiao Ming has existing clients (not starting from scratch)
- Sarah is clearly a hot lead (urgent.high vs. others)
- Discovery of Linda creates narrative tension ("perfect match!")

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why only 7 contacts? Isn't that too few?**
A: 7 is the cognitive sweet spot for demos:
- Large enough to show filtering value
- Small enough for audience to comprehend results
- Realistic for "one day's new contacts"
- Can reference "30 clients" in narration (beyond demo scope)

**Q: Why does Linda match Sarah exactly?**
A: This demonstrates **pattern recognition**‚Äîthe killer feature. It's not just filtering inputs; it's discovering connections the user didn't know existed.

**Q: What if someone asks about sellers with 4-room listings?**
A: James Tan has `listing.4room` but in Jurong at $550k, so he won't appear in the Tampines/$500k filter. This shows precision‚Äî**filtering works correctly**.

**Q: Should I show all bonus filters?**
A: Pick 1-2 based on time. Recommended:
1. `filter r/buyer` (quick, impressive count)
2. `filter t/location.tampines` (shows geographic power)
