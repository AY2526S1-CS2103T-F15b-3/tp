## üéØ Main Demo Commands (In Order)

### Step 1: Add Sarah (The Hot Lead)
```bash
add n/Sarah Tan p/91234567 e/sarah.tan@email.com a/Blk 123 Tampines St 11 #05-67 r/buyer t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4
```
**Expected:** Sarah added as contact #7  
**Verify:** Run `list` - should show 7 contacts

---

### Step 2: Filter Urgent Leads
```bash
filter t/urgent.high
```
**Expected:** Shows ONLY Sarah (1 contact)  
**Talking Point:** "Out of 7 contacts, only ONE has urgent.high. That's precision."

---

### Step 3: Find Matching Properties
```bash
filter t/listing.4room t/location.tampines t/budget.500k
```
**Expected:** Shows Linda ONLY (1 seller with matching property)  
**Why:** Linda has ALL 3 tags. James has only listing.4room. Sarah has location.tampines and budget.500k but not listing.4room.  
**Talking Point:** "Linda has the PERFECT property for Sarah! TrackerGuru just found an immediate viewing opportunity."

**Note:** Multiple tags use AND logic - contact must have ALL specified tags.

---

### Step 3b: Return to Full List (Find Contact Numbers)
```bash
list
```
**Expected:** Shows all 7 contacts  
**Important:** Note contact positions - Sarah is #7, Linda is #4  
**Talking Point:** "Linda's property is perfect for Sarah. Now let's track this deal for both parties."

---

### Step 4a: Update Sarah - Viewing Scheduled
```bash
edit 7 s/PENDING t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled
```
**Expected:** Sarah (contact #7) now has status PENDING and 5 tags (added viewing.scheduled)  
**Talking Point:** "Sarah's viewing scheduled. Notice: contact #7, not #1."

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** Edit #7 because Sarah is the 7th contact in the full list!

---

### Step 4b: Update Linda - Viewing Scheduled
```bash
edit 4 s/PENDING t/listing.4room t/location.tampines t/budget.500k t/viewing.scheduled
```
**Expected:** Linda (contact #4) updated with viewing.scheduled tag  
**Talking Point:** "Both sides of the transaction tracked. No forms, no menus. Just type and go."

---

### Step 5a: Update Sarah - Offer Made
```bash
edit 7 s/PENDING t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled t/offer.made
```
**Expected:** Sarah now has 6 tags (added offer.made)  
**Talking Point:** "Sarah's offer documented."

---

### Step 5b: Update Linda - Offer Received
```bash
edit 4 s/PENDING t/listing.4room t/location.tampines t/budget.500k t/viewing.scheduled t/offer.received
```
**Expected:** Linda now has offer.received tag  
**Talking Point:** "Linda's property has an offer. Complete timeline for both parties."

---

### Step 6a: Close Deal - Sarah
```bash
edit 7 s/COMPLETED t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled t/offer.made t/deal.closed
```
**Expected:** Status COMPLETED, removed urgent.high, added deal.closed (6 tags total)  
**Talking Point:** "Sarah's deal: COMPLETED. Urgency cleared."

**Note:** Intentionally removed urgent.high (deal closed, no longer urgent)

---

### Step 6b: Close Deal - Linda
```bash
edit 4 s/COMPLETED t/listing.4room t/location.tampines t/budget.500k t/viewing.scheduled t/offer.received t/deal.closed
```
**Expected:** Linda's status COMPLETED, added deal.closed  
**Talking Point:** "Linda's property: SOLD. Two contacts. Two weeks. Zero leads lost. One successful transaction."

---

### Step 7: Show Final Result
```bash
list
```
**Expected:** Shows all 7 contacts with Sarah marked as COMPLETED

---

**Expected:** 3 contacts (Sarah, Mary, Michelle)  
**Talking Point:** "Need to see all buyers? One command."

---

### Show All 4-Room Listings

```
**Expected:** 2 contacts (James, Linda)

filter s/COMPLETED
```
**Expected:** Shows Sarah (and any other completed deals)  
**Talking Point:** "All closed deals at a glance."

---

### Return to Full List
```bash
list
```
**Talking Point:** "Any filter. Any time. Always one command away from your full contact base."

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Reminders

### Tag Filtering Logic
- **Multiple tags use AND logic** - Contact must have ALL specified tags
- Example: `filter t/listing.4room t/location.tampines t/budget.500k`
  - Shows contacts with listing.4room AND location.tampines AND budget.500k
  - Does NOT show contacts with only 1 or 2 of these tags

### Edit Command Behavior
- **NOT cumulative** - Must re-specify ALL tags
- **Status field** - Use `s/PENDING` or `s/COMPLETED`
- **Tag preservation** - Include every tag you want to keep

### Tag Evolution Through Demo

**Sarah (Buyer - Contact #7):**
| Step | Status | Tags Count | Key Change |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Add | none | 4 | Initial tags |
| Viewing | PENDING | 5 | +viewing.scheduled |
| Offer | PENDING | 6 | +offer.made |
| Close | COMPLETED | 6 | -urgent.high, +deal.closed |

**Linda (Seller - Contact #4):**
| Step | Status | Tags Count | Key Change |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Setup | none | 3 | Initial tags |
| Viewing | PENDING | 4 | +viewing.scheduled |
| Offer | PENDING | 5 | +offer.received |
| Close | COMPLETED | 5 | +deal.closed |

### Expected Filter Counts
| Command | Count | Names |
|---------|-------|-------|
| `list` | 7 | All contacts |
| `filter t/urgent.high` | 1 | Sarah only |
| `filter t/listing.4room t/location.tampines t/budget.500k` | 1 | Linda (seller with property) |
| `filter r/buyer` | 3 | Sarah, Mary, Michelle |
| `filter t/location.tampines` | 2 | Sarah (buyer), Linda (seller) |
