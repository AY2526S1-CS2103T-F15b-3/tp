## üéØ Main Demo Commands (In Order)

### Step 1: Add Sarah (The Hot Lead)
```bash
add n/Sarah Tan p/91234567 e/sarah.tan@email.com a/Blk 123 Tampines St 11 #05-67 r/buyer t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4
```
**Expected:** Sarah added as contact #7  
**Verify:** Run `list` - should show 7 contacts

---

### Step 2: Filter Urgent Leads
```bash
filter t/urgent.high
```
**Expected:** Shows ONLY Sarah (1 contact)  
**Talking Point:** "Out of 7 contacts, only ONE has urgent.high. That's precision."

---

### Step 3: Find Matching Properties
```bash
filter t/rooms.4 t/location.tampines t/budget.500k
```
**Expected:** Shows Linda (#1) AND Sarah (#2) - both have ALL 3 tags  
**Why:** Linda is seller with rooms.4 property, Sarah is buyer seeking rooms.4. James has rooms.4 but in Jurong. Others don't have all 3 tags.  
**Talking Point:** "Linda HAS what Sarah WANTS! A 4-room in Tampines at $500k. TrackerGuru just matched buyer and seller instantly."

**Note:** Multiple tags use AND logic - contact must have ALL specified tags.  
**CRITICAL:** Stay on this filtered view! Linda is #1, Sarah is #2. All subsequent edits use these numbers!

---

### Step 4a: Update Linda - Viewing Scheduled
```bash
edit 1 s/PENDING t/rooms.4 t/location.tampines t/budget.500k t/viewing.scheduled
```
**Expected:** Linda (contact #1 in filtered view) updated with status PENDING and viewing.scheduled tag  
**Result:** Returns to full list after edit

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** Edit #1 because Linda is first in the FILTERED list (not full list)!

---

### Step 4b: Filter Back and Update Sarah
```bash
filter t/rooms.4 t/location.tampines t/budget.500k
```
**Expected:** Shows Linda (#1) and Sarah (#2) again  
**Talking Point:** "Filter back to our matched pair."

```bash
edit 2 s/PENDING t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled
```
**Expected:** Sarah (contact #2) updated with viewing.scheduled tag, status set to PENDING  
**Talking Point:** "Both sides tracked. Simple. Fast."

---

### Step 5a: Filter Back and Update Linda - Offer Received
```bash
filter t/rooms.4 t/location.tampines t/budget.500k
```
**Expected:** Shows Linda (#1) and Sarah (#2) again

```bash
edit 1 t/rooms.4 t/location.tampines t/budget.500k t/viewing.scheduled t/offer.received
```
**Expected:** Linda now has offer.received tag  
**Note:** No s/PENDING needed - status already PENDING from Step 4  
**Talking Point:** "Linda's property: offer received."

---

### Step 5b: Filter Back and Update Sarah - Offer Made
```bash
filter t/rooms.4 t/location.tampines t/budget.500k
```
**Expected:** Shows Linda (#1) and Sarah (#2) again

```bash
edit 2 t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled t/offer.made
```
**Expected:** Sarah now has offer.made tag (6 tags total)  
**Note:** No s/PENDING needed - status already PENDING from Step 4  
**Talking Point:** "Sarah's offer: documented. Complete timeline for both parties."

---

### Step 6a: Filter Back and Close Deal - Linda
```bash
filter t/rooms.4 t/location.tampines t/budget.500k
```
**Expected:** Shows Linda (#1) and Sarah (#2) again

```bash
edit 1 s/COMPLETED t/rooms.4 t/location.tampines t/budget.500k t/viewing.scheduled t/offer.received t/deal.closed
```
**Expected:** Linda's status changed to COMPLETED, added deal.closed  
**Note:** NOW we specify s/COMPLETED - changing status from PENDING  
**Talking Point:** "Linda's property: SOLD. Status COMPLETED."

---

### Step 6b: Filter Back and Close Deal - Sarah
```bash
filter t/rooms.4 t/location.tampines t/budget.500k
```
**Expected:** Shows Linda (#1) and Sarah (#2) again

```bash
edit 2 s/COMPLETED t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled t/offer.made t/deal.closed
```
**Expected:** Status COMPLETED, removed urgent.high, added deal.closed (6 tags total)  
**Note:** Specify s/COMPLETED to change status. Intentionally removed urgent.high (deal closed)  
**Talking Point:** "Sarah's deal: COMPLETED. Urgency cleared. Two contacts. Two weeks. Zero leads lost."

---

### Step 7: Show Final Result
```bash
list
```
**Expected:** Shows all 7 contacts with Sarah marked as COMPLETED

---

## üéÅ Bonus Demonstrations (If Time Permits)

### Show All Buyers
```bash
filter r/buyer
```
**Expected:** 3 contacts (Sarah, Mary, Michelle)  
**Talking Point:** "Need to see all buyers? One command."

---

### Show All 4-Room Listings
```bash
filter t/listing.4room
```
**Expected:** 2 contacts (James, Linda)  
**Talking Point:** "All 4-room properties instantly. Linda's is in Tampines‚Äîperfect for Sarah."

---

### Show All Tampines Contacts
```bash
filter t/location.tampines
```
**Expected:** 2 contacts (Sarah - buyer, Linda - seller with property)  
**Talking Point:** "Geographic targeting‚Äîbuyer and seller in the same area. That's a deal waiting to happen."

---

### Show All $500k Budget Contacts
```bash
filter t/budget.500k
```
**Expected:** 2 contacts (Sarah, Linda)  
**Talking Point:** "Sarah's budget matches Linda's listing price exactly. Perfect alignment."

---

### Filter by Status
```bash
filter s/COMPLETED
```
**Expected:** Shows Sarah (and any other completed deals)  
**Talking Point:** "All closed deals at a glance."

---

### Return to Full List
```bash
list
```
**Talking Point:** "Any filter. Any time. Always one command away from your full contact base."

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Reminders

### Tag Filtering Logic
- **Multiple tags use AND logic** - Contact must have ALL specified tags
- Example: `filter t/listing.4room t/location.tampines t/budget.500k`
  - Shows contacts with listing.4room AND location.tampines AND budget.500k
  - Does NOT show contacts with only 1 or 2 of these tags

### Edit Command Behavior
- **NOT cumulative** - Must re-specify ALL tags
- **Status field** - Use `s/PENDING` or `s/COMPLETED`
- **Tag preservation** - Include every tag you want to keep

### Tag Evolution Through Demo

**Sarah (Buyer - Contact #7):**
| Step | Status | Tags Count | Key Change |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Add | none | 4 | Initial tags |
| Viewing | PENDING | 5 | +viewing.scheduled |
| Offer | PENDING | 6 | +offer.made |
| Close | COMPLETED | 6 | -urgent.high, +deal.closed |

**Linda (Seller - Contact #4):**
| Step | Status | Tags Count | Key Change |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Setup | none | 3 | Initial tags |
| Viewing | PENDING | 4 | +viewing.scheduled |
| Offer | PENDING | 5 | +offer.received |
| Close | COMPLETED | 5 | +deal.closed |

### Expected Filter Counts
| Command | Count | Names |
|---------|-------|-------|
| `list` | 7 | All contacts |
| `filter t/urgent.high` | 1 | Sarah only |
| `filter t/rooms.4 t/location.tampines t/budget.500k` | 2 | Linda (#1 seller), Sarah (#2 buyer) |
| `filter r/buyer` | 3 | Sarah, Mary, Michelle |
| `filter t/location.tampines` | 2 | Sarah (buyer), Linda (seller) |
