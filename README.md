* Property agents juggle scattered client and property data across multiple projects. TrackerGuru is a CLI app that gives fast typists a lightweight, keyboard-first workspace to instantly add, search, and update contacts with no clutter, no clicks. It provides speed, structure, and focus that lets agents close deals faster.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _TrackerGuru_) used by Property Agents for managing contact details.
* It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
  * For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[TrackerGuru Product Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f15b-3.github.io/tp)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative and based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
