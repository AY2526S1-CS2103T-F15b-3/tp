# Demo Update Summary - Status Field & Tag Preservation

## Changes Made

I've updated your demo materials to address two critical issues:

### 1. ‚úÖ Use Status Field Instead of Status Tags
**Problem:** Demo was using status tags (`t/status.viewing`) which don't exist  
**Solution:** Now uses the actual Status enum field (`s/PENDING`, `s/COMPLETED`)

### 2. ‚úÖ Preserve Tags During Edits
**Problem:** Edit commands were removing previous tags  
**Solution:** All edit commands now re-specify existing tags to preserve them

---

## What Changed

### Demo Script (DEMO_SCRIPT.md)

#### Step 4: Viewing Scheduled
**Before:**
```bash
edit 1 t/status.viewing
```

**After:**
```bash
edit 1 s/PENDING t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled
```

**Why:** 
- Uses Status field (`s/PENDING`) instead of non-existent status tag
- Preserves all 4 original tags
- Adds new `viewing.scheduled` tag

---

#### Step 5: Offer Made
**Before:**
```bash
edit 1 t/status.offer-made
```

**After:**
```bash
edit 1 s/PENDING t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled t/offer.made
```

**Why:**
- Keeps Status as PENDING
- Preserves all 5 existing tags
- Adds new `offer.made` tag

---

#### Step 6: Deal Closed
**Before:**
```bash
edit 1 t/status.closed t/urgent.none
```

**After:**
```bash
edit 1 s/COMPLETED t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled t/offer.made t/deal.closed
```

**Why:**
- Changes Status to COMPLETED (proper use of enum field)
- Intentionally removes `urgent.high` (deal closed, no longer urgent)
- Preserves descriptive tags (budget, location, rooms)
- Preserves timeline tags (viewing.scheduled, offer.made)
- Adds final `deal.closed` tag

---

## Key Understanding: How Edit Works

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Concept
**Edit command is NOT cumulative for tags!**

You must **re-specify ALL tags** you want to keep. Tags not included are removed.

### Example
```bash
# Sarah has: t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4

# Wrong (loses all original tags):
edit 1 t/viewing.scheduled

# Correct (preserves all tags):
edit 1 t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled
```

## Tag Evolution Through Demo

### After Add (Step 1)
```
Status: (none)
Tags: urgent.high, budget.500k, location.tampines, rooms.4
```

### After Viewing (Step 4)
```
Status: PENDING
Tags: urgent.high, budget.500k, location.tampines, rooms.4, viewing.scheduled
```
‚Üí **Added:** Status field, viewing.scheduled tag

### After Offer (Step 5)
```
Status: PENDING
Tags: urgent.high, budget.500k, location.tampines, rooms.4, viewing.scheduled, offer.made
```
‚Üí **Added:** offer.made tag

### After Close (Step 6)
```
Status: COMPLETED
Tags: budget.500k, location.tampines, rooms.4, viewing.scheduled, offer.made, deal.closed
```
‚Üí **Changed:** Status to COMPLETED  
‚Üí **Removed:** urgent.high (intentionally)  
‚Üí **Added:** deal.closed tag

---

## Narrative Benefits

### 1. Proper Status Usage
- Shows understanding of application architecture
- Uses enum field for its intended purpose
- Status tracks high-level deal stage

### 2. Tag Timeline
Tags build a complete audit trail:
- **Criteria tags** (budget, location, rooms) = persistent needs
- **Urgency tag** (urgent.high) = temporary priority indicator
- **Milestone tags** (viewing, offer, closed) = deal progression

### 3. Professional Data Management
- Nothing is lost accidentally
- Selective removal (urgent.high) shows intentionality
- Complete history maintained

---

## Verification Commands

Before demo, test this sequence:

```bash
# 1. Add Sarah
add n/Sarah Tan p/91234567 e/sarah.tan@email.com a/Blk 123 Tampines St 11 #05-67 r/buyer t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4

# 2. Check tags (should have 4 tags, no status)
list

# 3. Add viewing
edit 1 s/PENDING t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled

# 4. Verify (should have PENDING status, 5 tags)
list

# 5. Add offer
edit 1 s/PENDING t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled t/offer.made

# 6. Verify (should have PENDING status, 6 tags)
list

# 7. Close deal
edit 1 s/COMPLETED t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled t/offer.made t/deal.closed

# 8. Verify (should have COMPLETED status, 6 tags, no urgent.high)
list
```

**Expected Final State:**
- Status: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- Tags Present: budget.500k, location.tampines, rooms.4, viewing.scheduled, offer.made, deal.closed ‚úÖ
- Tags Removed: urgent.high ‚úÖ

## Talking Points Updated

### Step 4
**Old:** "Notice: no forms, no menus..."  
**New:** "The status field tracks the overall stage, while tags maintain the detailed criteria."

**Impact:** Demonstrates architectural understanding

### Step 5
**Old:** "Every update is a checkpoint..."  
**New:** "The tags build a timeline‚Äîfrom initial contact to offer, everything documented."

**Impact:** Shows intentional data design

### Step 6
**Old:** "One contact. Two weeks. Zero leads lost."  
**New:** "Status changed to COMPLETED. Urgency cleared. Deal closed tag added."

**Impact:** Explicit narration of what changed and why

---

## Why These Changes Matter

### 1. Technical Accuracy
- Uses actual application features (Status enum)
- Demonstrates understanding of data model
- No reliance on non-existent features

### 2. Professional Credibility
- Shows proper tag management
- Demonstrates progressive documentation
- Intentional data curation (removing urgent.high)

### 3. Demo Reliability
- Commands will work exactly as shown
- No surprise behavior during presentation
- Verifiable results at each step

## Pre-Demo Checklist

Before presenting:
- [ ] Review DEMO_EDIT_COMMAND_NOTES.md
- [ ] Practice edit commands 3-5 times
- [ ] Verify tag preservation after each edit
- [ ] Check Status field changes correctly
- [ ] Have commands ready to copy-paste
- [ ] Test full sequence once before demo

---

## Quick Reference: Copy-Paste Commands

```bash
# Step 4: Viewing
edit 1 s/PENDING t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled

# Step 5: Offer
edit 1 s/PENDING t/urgent.high t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled t/offer.made

# Step 6: Close
edit 1 s/COMPLETED t/budget.500k t/location.tampines t/rooms.4 t/viewing.scheduled t/offer.made t/deal.closed
```
