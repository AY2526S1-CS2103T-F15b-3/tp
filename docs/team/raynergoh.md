## Project: TrackerGuru

Property agents juggle scattered client and property data across multiple projects. 
TrackerGuru is a CLI app gives fast typists a lightweight, keyboard-first workspace to instantly 
add, search, and update contacts with no clutter, no clicks. 
It provides speed, structure, and focus that lets agents close deals faster.
