## **Design**

### Architecture
<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* Note: Some commands like `ListCommand`, `StatsCommand`, `ClearCommand`, `ExitCommand`, and `HelpCommand` do not require parsers as they take no parameters.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has:
- A **Tag list** in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references
- A **Role list** in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references
- A **TagGroup set** in the `AddressBook`, which `Tag` optionally references

This allows `AddressBook` to:
- Only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects
- Only require one `Role` object per unique role, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Role` objects
- Maintain a centralized collection of `TagGroup` objects for organizing tags into categories (e.g., "PropertyType", "Location")

Tags can optionally belong to a TagGroup, enabling structured organization and group-based filtering of contacts.

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

Address book data is persisted as a JSON file through `JsonSerializableAddressBook`, which contains:

* A list of `JsonAdaptedPerson` objects (each containing `JsonAdaptedTag` and `JsonAdaptedRole` objects)

* A list of `JsonAdaptedTagGroup` objects representing tag categories



This structure enables centralized storage of tag groups alongside person data, maintaining consistency with the Model component's tag group management.
### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Duplicate Handling

#### Implementation

The duplicate handling mechanism ensures that no two contacts in the address book can have the same name, phone number or email. This is important for property agents who need to maintain unique contact information for each client, as these fields serve as critical identifiers for communication and identification.

The feature is implemented through checks in the `Model` component, specifically:

* `Model#hasPerson(Person person)` — Checks if any existing person in the address book has the same name as the given person.
* `Model#hasSamePhoneNumber(Person person)` — Checks if any existing person in the address book has the same phone number as the given person.
* `Model#hasSameEmail(Person person)` — Checks if any existing person in the address book has the same email as the given person.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface and implemented in `ModelManager`, which delegates the checks to `AddressBook` and ultimately to `UniquePersonList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the duplicate handling mechanism behaves. For illustration purposes, we will use phone number as the example, though the same logic applies to name and email checks.

Step 1. The user attempts to add a new contact John with phone number 12345678 by executing the command `add n/John p/12345678 e/john@example.com a/123 Street r/Buyer s/Pending`. The `AddCommand` is created and executed.

Step 2. During execution, `AddCommand` first checks if the exact person (exact name) already exists using `Model#hasPerson(toAdd)`. This check passes (returns false) as John is a new contact.

Step 3. `AddCommand` then performs duplicate checks for phone number and email:
   * Checks for duplicate phone number by calling `Model#hasSamePhoneNumber(toAdd)` (illustrated in the sequence diagram below)
   * Checks for duplicate email by calling `Model#hasSameEmail(toAdd)`

   Each check cascades through the components:
   * `ModelManager` calls the corresponding `AddressBook` method (e.g. `AddressBook#hasSamePhoneNumber(person)`)
   * `AddressBook` calls the corresponding `UniquePersonList` method (e.g. `UniquePersonList#containsPhoneNumber(person)`)
   * `UniquePersonList` iterates through all persons to check if any existing person has the same field value

Step 4. If any of the checks return true (e.g. the phone number 12345678 already exists belonging to another contact Alice), `AddCommand` throws a `CommandException` with an appropriate error message such as "This phone number already exists in the address book".

Step 5. If all checks pass (return false), the new contact is successfully added to the address book.

The following sequence diagram shows how the duplicate phone number check works during the execution of an add command (the same pattern applies to name and email checks):

<puml src="diagrams/DuplicatePhoneHandlingSequenceDiagram.puml"/>

<box type="info" seamless>

</box>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: When to perform the duplicate field checks:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check during command execution in `AddCommand` and `EditCommand`.
  * Pros:
    * Simple and straightforward implementation.
    * Error detection happens at the business logic layer, providing clear feedback to users.
    * Consistent with existing duplicate person checking mechanism.
    * Allows for specific error messages for each field type (name, phone, email).
  * Cons:
    * The checks are performed separately in multiple command classes, leading to some code duplication.

* **Alternative 2:** Enforce uniqueness constraints at the `UniquePersonList` level.
  * Pros:
    * Centralized validation logic in the model layer.
    * Automatically applies to all operations that modify the person list.
  * Cons:
    * Less control over error messages for different commands.

**Aspect: Scope of the uniqueness checks:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Names, phone numbers and emails must be globally unique across all contacts.
  * Pros:
    * Prevents confusion and data integrity issues.
    * Aligns with real-world expectation that these fields uniquely identify individuals.
    * Simplifies contact management for property agents who rely on these identifiers.
  * Cons:
    * May be overly restrictive in some scenarios.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow duplicate fields but warn the user.
  * Pros:
    * More flexible for edge cases.
    * Still alerts users to potential data entry errors.
  * Cons:
    * May lead to confusion when the same contact information appears for multiple people.
    * Could result in unintended duplicates if users ignore warnings.

### Tag Group Management feature

#### Overview

The Tag Group Management feature allows users to organize tags into logical categories (tag groups). This helps property agents categorize and manage their contacts more effectively by grouping related tags together (e.g., `propertyType`, `location`, `priceRange`).

Tag groups provide the following benefits:
* **Better organization**: Group related tags together for easier management
* **Improved filtering**: Filter contacts by tag group categories
* **Clearer structure**: Instantly see which category each tag belongs to

#### Implementation

The Tag Group Management feature is implemented through multiple layers of the application:

##### Model Layer

**Core Classes:**
* `TagGroup`: Represents a tag group with an alphanumeric name. Ensures immutability and validates names using regex patterns.
* `Tag`: Modified to optionally reference a `TagGroup`. Tags can exist independently or be associated with a group.
* `AddressBook`: Maintains a `Set<TagGroup>` to store all created tag groups. Provides methods to add, remove, and check tag groups.
* `Model` interface: Exposes operations for tag group management (`addTagGroup`, `deleteTagGroup`, `hasTagGroup`, `isTagGroupInUse`).

**Key Methods:**
* `Model#addTagGroup(TagGroup)`: Adds a new tag group to the address book if it doesn't already exist.
* `Model#deleteTagGroup(TagGroup)`: Removes a tag group from the address book after validation.
* `Model#hasTagGroup(TagGroup)`: Checks if a tag group exists in the address book.
* `Model#isTagGroupInUse(TagGroup)`: Checks if any person's tags reference the specified tag group. Uses Java Streams with `flatMap()` and `anyMatch()` for efficient checking.

##### Logic Layer

**Command Classes:**
* `TagGroupCommand`: Creates a new tag group or lists all existing tag groups. Handles both parameterized (create) and parameterless (list) executions.
* `DeleteTagGroupCommand`: Deletes a tag group after checking that it's not in use by any person's tags.

**Parser Classes:**
* `TagGroupCommandParser`: Parses user input for the `tg` command. Distinguishes between listing (no arguments) and creating (with GROUP_NAME argument).
* `DeleteTagGroupCommandParser`: Parses user input for the `dtg` command and validates the tag group name.

**Command Execution Flow:**
1. User enters a tag group command (e.g., `tg propertyType`)
2. `AddressBookParser` routes to the appropriate parser
3. Parser validates input and creates the command object
4. Command executes by interacting with the `Model`
5. Result is returned to the UI layer

##### Storage Layer

**Storage Classes:**
* `JsonAdaptedTagGroup`: Jackson-friendly adapter class for `TagGroup` serialization/deserialization.
* `JsonSerializableAddressBook`: Extended to include a `List<JsonAdaptedTagGroup>` field for persisting tag groups.

**Persistence Flow:**
* Tag groups are serialized to JSON alongside persons in `addressbook.json`
* On application startup, tag groups are deserialized and loaded into the `AddressBook`
* Tag groups persist across sessions automatically

#### Usage Scenarios

##### Scenario 1: Creating a Tag Group

**User Goal:** Create a tag group called `propertyType`

**Steps:**
1. User executes `tg propertyType`
2. `AddressBookParser` creates a `TagGroupCommandParser`
3. `TagGroupCommandParser` parses the input and creates a `TagGroupCommand` with the group name
4. `TagGroupCommand#execute()` checks if the tag group already exists using `Model#hasTagGroup()`
5. If it doesn't exist, `Model#addTagGroup()` is called to add the tag group
6. Success message "Tag group created: propertyType" is displayed to the user

**Sequence Diagram:**

<puml src="diagrams/TagGroupCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="TagGroupCommandSequenceDiagram" />

The sequence diagram above illustrates the interaction between Logic and Model components when creating a tag group.

##### Scenario 2: Listing Tag Groups

**User Goal:** View all created tag groups

**Steps:**
1. User executes `tg` (without arguments)
2. `AddressBookParser` creates a `TagGroupCommandParser`
3. `TagGroupCommandParser` detects no arguments and creates a `TagGroupCommand` for listing
4. `TagGroupCommand#execute()` retrieves all tag groups using `Model#getTagGroupList()`
5. List of tag groups is formatted and displayed to the user

##### Scenario 3: Deleting a Tag Group

**User Goal:** Delete an unused tag group called `propertyType`

**Steps:**
1. User executes `dtg propertyType`
2. `AddressBookParser` creates a `DeleteTagGroupCommandParser`
3. `DeleteTagGroupCommandParser` parses the input and creates a `DeleteTagGroupCommand`
4. `DeleteTagGroupCommand#execute()` performs validation:
    - Checks if the tag group exists using `Model#hasTagGroup()`
    - Checks if it's in use using `Model#isTagGroupInUse()`
5. If validation passes, `Model#deleteTagGroup()` is called
6. Success message "Tag group deleted: propertyType" is displayed

**Activity Diagram:**

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteTagGroupActivityDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteTagGroupActivityDiagram" />

The activity diagram above shows the decision flow when deleting a tag group, including validation steps.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Tag Group Deletion Policy**

**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Prevent deletion if tag group is in use
- **Pros**: Data integrity maintained, prevents orphaned tags
- **Cons**: Requires manual tag cleanup before group deletion
- **Rationale**: Chosen to avoid accidental data loss and maintain referential integrity

**Alternative 2**: Cascade delete all associated tags
- **Pros**: Simpler workflow for bulk cleanup
- **Cons**: High risk of unintended data loss, no undo mechanism

**Alternative 3**: Convert to untagged status
- **Pros**: Preserves tag associations while removing group
- **Cons**: Creates inconsistent state, defeats purpose of grouping

**Aspect: Tag group storage structure**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store as a `Set<TagGroup>` in `AddressBook`
    * Pros: Simple and efficient; automatic duplicate prevention
    * Pros: Fast lookup for existence checks (O(1) on average with HashSet)
    * Cons: Not ordered; tag groups displayed in arbitrary order

* **Alternative 2:** Store as a `Map<String, TagGroup>` keyed by tag group name
    * Pros: Slightly faster lookup by name (explicit key-based access)
    * Cons: Redundant since `TagGroup` already contains its name
    * Cons: Requires additional boilerplate code for synchronization

* **Alternative 3:** Store as a sorted list for ordered display
    * Pros: Tag groups displayed in alphabetical order
    * Cons: Slower insertion and duplicate checking (O(n))
    * Cons: Additional complexity in maintaining sort order

**Justification:** Alternative 1 was chosen for its simplicity and efficiency. The unordered nature of the Set is not a significant drawback since tag groups can be sorted when displayed if needed.

**Aspect: Tag and TagGroup relationship design**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Tags optionally reference TagGroup; TagGroups don't maintain lists of Tags
    * Pros: Simple unidirectional relationship; easier to maintain consistency
    * Pros: Tags can exist independently without a group
    * Cons: Finding all tags in a group requires scanning all persons' tags

* **Alternative 2:** Bidirectional relationship where TagGroups maintain lists of associated Tags
    * Pros: Easy to find all tags in a group
    * Cons: Complex bidirectional synchronization required
    * Cons: Harder to maintain consistency when tags are added/removed from persons

**Justification:** Alternative 1 was chosen to minimize complexity and avoid synchronization issues. The use case of "finding all tags in a group" is rare compared to checking if a tag belongs to a group.

#### Validation Rules

The following validation rules are enforced for tag group operations:

1. **Tag group names:**
    * Must be alphanumeric (letters and numbers only)
    * Cannot contain spaces or special characters
    * Validated using regex pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$`
    * Validation occurs in the `TagGroup` constructor

2. **Creating tag groups:**
    * Duplicate tag group names are not allowed
    * Checked using `Model#hasTagGroup()` before adding
    * Case-sensitive comparison (e.g., `PropertyType` ≠ `propertytype`)

3. **Deleting tag groups:**
    * Tag group must exist in the address book
    * Tag group cannot be in use by any person's tags
    * Checked using `Model#isTagGroupInUse()` which:
        - Iterates through all persons
        - Flattens all tags using `flatMap()`
        - Uses `anyMatch()` to check if any tag references the group

4. **Tags with groups:**
    * Format: `t/GROUP.VALUE` (e.g., `t/propertyType.HDB`)
    * The group name before the dot must match an existing tag group
    * Validated during tag parsing in `ParserUtil#parseTags()`

#### Error Handling

The feature implements comprehensive error handling for various edge cases:

| Error Scenario | Command | Error Message |
|----------------|---------|---------------|
| Invalid tag group name (contains spaces) | `tg property type` | Tag group names should be alphanumeric |
| Invalid tag group name (special chars) | `tg property-type!` | Tag group names should be alphanumeric |
| Duplicate tag group | `tg propertyType` (when it exists) | This tag group already exists in the address book. |
| Delete non-existent tag group | `dtg location` (doesn't exist) | The tag group location does not exist. |
| Delete tag group in use | `dtg propertyType` (when in use) | This tag group is currently in use and cannot be deleted. Please remove all tags associated with this group first. |


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Saving data

1. **Dealing with missing/corrupted data files**

    1. **Simulating a corrupted data file:**
        - Locate the data file at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`
        - Open it with a text editor
        - Delete a random closing brace `}` or bracket `]`
        - Save and close the file
        - Relaunch TrackerGuru

       **Expected:** TrackerGuru starts with an empty address book. The corrupted file is not overwritten by closing the window unless the user enters `exit`.

    1. **Simulating a missing data file:**
        - Delete the `addressbook.json` file from the `data` folder
        - Relaunch TrackerGuru

       **Expected:** TrackerGuru starts with sample contacts (default data).

    1. **Simulating invalid tag group references:**
        - Open `addressbook.json`
        - Find a person with a tag like `"PropertyType.HDB"`
        - In the `tagGroups` array, delete the `{"tagGroupName": "PropertyType"}` entry
        - Save and relaunch

       **Expected:** For data resilience, TrackerGuru commands still work normally with tag group `PropertyType` and does not affect normal operations.
   Only when listing using `tg`, `PropertyType` will not appear.
