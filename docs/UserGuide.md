## Features
In this section, you’ll explore how to add, update and organise your contacts using TrackerGuru’s contact management commands.

Before proceeding with the commands in this section, please take a moment to review the notes below to understand the usage of command parameters and symbols, as well as understand how roles, tags and tag groups can be effectively utilised for contact organisation.

<box type="info" seamless>

##### Command Format Notes

* **Parameters**: `UPPER_CASE` words should be supplied by the user.
  <br> e.g. `add n/NAME`: replace `NAME` with an actual name such as `add n/John Doe`.

* **Optional fields**: Items in `[square brackets]` are optional.
  <br> e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]`: both `n/John Doe t/friend` and `n/John Doe` are acceptable.

* **Repeatable fields**: Items followed by `…` can be repeated any number of times, including zero.
  <br> e.g. `[t/TAG]…`: valid usages are `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* **Flexible order**: Parameters can appear in any order.
  <br> e.g. both `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` and `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` are acceptable.

* **Commands without parameters**: `help`, `list`, `exit`, `clear`... will ignore any additional input.
  <br> e.g. `help 123` is interpreted as `help`.

### Understanding Roles

Each contact in TrackerGuru can have one or more roles that describe their professional relationship or purpose to you:

**Why use Roles?**
- **Better segmentation**: Classify contacts easily by their professional relationship
- **Easier filtering**: For example, use `filter r/Landlord r/Tenant` to find all landlords or tenants
- **Flexible categorization**: A single contact can play multiple roles (e.g. Buyer and Lawyer)

**Example Contact with Roles:**

`add n/John Tan p/91234567 e/john@example.com a/Blk 456 Bishan 
r/Buyer 
r/Lawyer `

### Understanding Tags and Tag Groups

TrackerGuru supports two ways to tag your contacts:

1. **Simple Tags**: Basic labels without categories
    - Example: `t/vip`, `t/priority`, `t/urgent`

2. **Tags with Groups** (recommended for organization): Tags organized into categories
    - Format: `t/GROUP.VALUE`
    - Example: `t/propertyType.HDB`, `t/location.Bishan`, `t/priceRange.500k-1M`

**Why use Tag Groups?**
- **Better organization**: Group related tags together (all property types, all locations, etc.)
- **Easier filtering**: For example, use `filter tg/propertyType` to find all contacts with any property type tag
- **Clearer contact management**: Instantly see which category each tag belongs to

**Example Contact with Tag Groups:**

`add n/John Tan p/91234567 e/john@example.com a/Blk 456 Bishan
r/Buyer
t/propertyType.HDB
t/location.Bishan
t/priceRange.500k-1M
t/priority`

In this example:
- `propertyType.HDB` - Tag with group (property type is HDB)
- `location.Bishan` - Tag with group (location is Bishan)
- `priceRange.500k-1M` - Tag with group (price range is 500k-1M)
- `priority` - Simple tag without group
  
<box type="tip" seamless>

**Note:** Tag VALUES (the part after the dot) can contain symbols like hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`), and dots (`.`) for more flexible categorization. 

However, it has to start with alphanumeric, and can contain any combination after. For example, `t/price.1.5M-2M` is valid, but `t/price.-2M` is not.

</box>

### Adding a person: `add`
###### Command: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [r/ROLE]…​ [s/STATUS] [t/TAG]…​`

Adds a person (see [definition](#person)) to the address book.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Note:**
* Each person must have a **unique** `PHONE_NUMBER` and `EMAIL`.
* Role is **optional**. You can add multiple roles by repeating `r/ROLE` but a contact made with **duplicate roles** will throw an error message. See [Role](#role) in the glossary for more details.
<br> Example: `r/Buyer r/Investor` is acceptable, `r/Buyer r/buyer` is unacceptable. 

* Status is **optional**. If provided, it must be `Pending` or `Completed` (case-insensitive). Each person can have only one status.

* Tags are **optional** and can be formatted as either:
    - `t/GROUP.VALUE`: both `GROUP` and `VALUE` are alphanumeric
    -  `t/TAG`: a single alphanumeric tag
</box>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe p/12345678 e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Betsy street, block 123 r/Seller s/Completed t/friend`
* `add n/Alex Tan p/87654321 e/alex@example.com a/Blk 456 r/Buyer r/Investor s/Pending`

### Editing a person : `edit`
###### Command: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [r/ROLE]…​ [s/STATUS] [t/TAG]…​`

Edits an existing person in the address book.

<box type="info" seamless>

**General**:

* Edit the person at the specified `INDEX`.
    - `INDEX` refers to the number shown beside each person in the displayed list.
    - `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one optional field must be provided for the edit to take effect.

**Field Updates**:
* The person's `name`, `phone`, `email`, and `address` will be replaced with the new values you enter.
* Editing **roles** replace all existing roles: roles are not **cumulative**.
    * You can specify multiple new roles using multiple `r/` prefixes (e.g. `r/Buyer r/Investor`).
* Editing **status** replaces the existing one.
    * Status must be either **Pending** or **Completed** (case-insensitive).
* Editing **tags** replaces all existing tags: tags are **not cumulative**.

**Removing all values from a field**:
* To remove all roles: type `r/` without any value.
* To remove all tags: type `t/` without any value.
* To remove the status: type `s/` without any value.
* `name`, `phone`, `email`, and `address` must always contain a value.

</box>

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 1 s/Completed` Edits the status of the 1st person to `Completed`. If the person did not have a status, it will be added.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.
*  `edit 3 r/Buyer r/Landlord` Replaces all existing roles of the 3rd person with `Buyer` and `Landlord`.
*  `edit 4 s/` Removes the status from the 4th person.

### Finding persons by name: `find`
###### Command: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]…​`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the provided keywords.

<box type="info" seamless>

* The search is **case-insensitive** (e.g `hans` will match `Hans`).
* The **order of the keywords does not matter** (e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`).
* Only the **name field** is searched.
* Only **full words** will be matched (e.g. `Han` does not match `Hans`).
* Persons matching **at least one keyword** will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
    * e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

</box>

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>

### Filtering persons by Role, Status, Tag Group: `filter`
###### Command: `filter [r/ROLE]…​ [s/STATUS]…​ [tg/TAG_GROUP]…​`

Filters the current list for persons matching the specified parameters.

<box type="info" seamless>

* The filtering of Roles is **case-insensitive**.
    * e.g. `r/buyer` will match `r/Buyer`
* You can filter with any combination of: **Role(s)**, **Status(es)**, **TagGroup(s)**
* You may specify multiple Roles, Statuses, and Tag Groups
* A person will be shown if they match **any** of the specified parameters
* If no parameters are provided, no filtering will occur

</box>

Examples:
* `filter r/buyer` returns all persons with the role **buyer**
* `filter s/pending s/completed` returns all persons whose status is **pending** or **completed**
* `filter r/buyer s/completed tg/price` returns all persons who are **buyers**, or whose status is **completed**, or has a tag whose Tag Group is **price**

### Deleting a person : `delete`
###### Command: `delete INDEX`

Deletes the specified person from the address book.

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

### Listing all persons : `list`
###### Command: `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the address book.

### Creating a Tag Group : `tg`
###### Command: `tg GROUP_NAME`

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes:**
* `GROUP_NAME` must be **alphanumeric** (letters and numbers only, no spaces or special characters).
* Tag group names are **case-sensitive** (e.g., `PropertyType` and `propertytype` are different).
* Duplicate tag group names are not allowed. If the tag group already exists, an error message will be shown.
* Once created, you can use the tag group when adding or editing contacts using the format `t/GROUP.VALUE`.

</box>

Examples:
* `tg propertyType` creates a tag group called `propertyType`.
* `tg location` creates a tag group called `location`.
* `tg priceRange` creates a tag group called `priceRange`.

**After creating a tag group**, you can assign tags within that group to contacts:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/john@example.com a/123 Street t/propertyType.HDB t/location.Bishan`
* `edit 1 t/propertyType.Condo t/priceRange.500k-1M`


### Deleting a Tag Group : `dtg`
###### Command: `dtg GROUP_NAME`

Deletes an existing tag group.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Important:**
* You **cannot delete a tag group** if it is currently in use by any contact's tags.
* To delete a tag group that's in use, you must first:
    1. Remove all tags using that group from your contacts (using the `edit` command), **OR**
    2. Delete the contacts that have tags in that group.
* Tag group names are **case-sensitive**.

</box>

Examples:
* `dtg propertyType` deletes the `propertyType` tag group (only if not in use).
* `dtg location` deletes the `location` tag group (only if not in use).

**Error scenarios:**
* **Tag group does not exist**: `The tag group propertyType does not exist.`

### Saving the data

TrackerGuru data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TrackerGuru data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/trackerguru.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file invalidate its format, TrackerGuru will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to save a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TrackerGuru to behave in unexpected ways (e.g. if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

##### **Q**: How do I check my Java version?
**A**: To verify your Java version:
1. Open a terminal and enter `java -version`
2. You should see an output similar to:
   ```
   java version "17.0.x"  // or any higher version
   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.x+xx)
   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.x+xx, mixed mode, sharing)
   ```
3. **If the command is not recognised** or the version is less than 17: Follow this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallation.html) for installation.
4. After installation, type `java -version` to verify the correct version.

##### **Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?
**A**: Follow the [Quick Start: Section](#quick-start) to install the app on the new computer. Then, locate the new TrackerGuru home folder and replace its data folder with the data folder from your old computer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file (in the same directory as the JAR file) created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

## Glossary
### Java
Java is a programming platform used to run applications like TrackerGuru. TrackerGuru requires Java 17 or above.

### GUI
GUI Stands for Graphical User Interface. It is the visual part of TrackerGuru that you interact with using windows, buttons, and text fields and displays all your contacts.

### Person
A Person represents an individual contact entry in TrackerGuru. Each person stores key information used by property agents to manage and categorize clients.

**Fields:**
- **Name (`n/`)** – The full name of the contact.
- **Phone (`p/`)** – The contact’s phone number.
- **Email (`e/`)** – The contact’s email address.
- **Address (`a/`)** – The contact’s physical address.

**Optional Fields:**
- **Role (`r/`)** – See definition of [Role](#role).
- **Status (`s/`)** – See definition of [Status](#status).
- **Tag (`t/`)** – See definition of [Tag](#tag).

Each Person is uniquely identified by their **Phone** or **Email**.
Multiple optional fields (Role, Status, Tag) allow you to flexibly organize your contacts according to your workflow.

### Role
A Role represents the professional relationship of a contact in your address book. 
<br> Each contact can have **multiple** roles but cannot have **duplicate** roles.

Common roles include:
- **Buyer**: Someone looking to purchase property
- **Seller**: Someone looking to sell property
- **Landlord**: Property owner who rents out properties
- **Tenant**: Someone looking to rent property
- **Investor**: Someone interested in property investment
- **etc**

**Case-insensitivity**: 
<br> `buyer`, `Buyer`, and `BUYER` are treated as the same role.
<br> Using both `r/buyer` and `r/BUYER` in a command will result in a duplicate role error.

**Format rules**:
- Roles may include letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens `-`, and underscores `_`.
- Roles **cannot** start with a hyphen or underscore.
- Roles **cannot** be blank.

### Status
A Status tracks the progress or state of your interaction with a contact. Each contact can have **only one status** (or none).

**Valid status values:**
- **Pending**: Initial contact or ongoing negotiation
- **Completed**: Transaction successfully finished

Status values are **case-insensitive** (e.g., "pending", "Pending", and "PENDING" are all valid). Only these two values are allowed.

### Tag
A Tag is an optional label used to provide additional information about a contact.
A Tag can also optionally contain a **tag group** (see [definition](#tag-group)), allowing it to be categorized under a specific group.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Note:**
* TrackerGuru must already contain the tag group for a tag to be assigned under said group.
  * Refer to [creating a tag group](#Creating-a-tag-group--tg).

</box>

Common tags include:
- **VIP**: High-priority or important contact
- **Follow-up**: Contact that requires a follow-up
- **HotLead**: Contact with immediate potential

Tags are **case-sensitive** (e.g., "VIP" and "vip" are treated as different tags).

### Tag Group
A Tag Group organizes tags into broader categories for more structured classification.
It is a way to group related tags under a shared category.

**How it works:**
- Tag groups are created using the `tg GROUP_NAME` command.
- Once created, you can assign tags within that group using the format `t/GROUP.VALUE`.
- Tag groups allow you to categorize tags into logical categories.

Common tag groups include:
- **PropertyType**:
    - Example tags using this group: `t/PropertyType.Condo`, `t/PropertyType.Landed`, `t/PropertyType.HDB`
- **Location**:
    - Example tags using this group: `t/Location.Bishan`, `t/Location.Woodlands`, `t/Location.Sengkang`
- **Project**:
    - Example tags using this group: `t/Project.X`, `t/Project.Y`, `t/Project.Z`

Tag groups are also **case-sensitive** (e.g., "Client" and "client" are treated differently), and are automatically saved and persist across sessions.
