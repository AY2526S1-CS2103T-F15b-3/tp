### Step 6: Help Guide

To access this User Guide anytime from the app, use the **`help`** command. A help window will open up, containing the User Guide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` and `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` are both acceptable.

* Tags should either be in the format:
  - `t/GROUP.VALUE` where both `GROUP` and `VALUE` are alphanumeric
  - a simple Tag `t/TAG` with an alphanumeric string

* Commands that do not require parameters (such as help, list, exit, and clear) will ignore any additional input.
  e.g. `help 123` will be interpreted as `help`.

* When using the PDF version of this document, note that copying multiple-line commands may remove spaces around line breaks. Please check that spaces are correct before pasting into the application.
</box>

### Understanding Tags and Tag Groups

TrackerGuru supports two ways to tag your contacts:

1. **Simple Tags**: Basic labels without categories
    - Example: `t/friend`, `t/priority`, `t/urgent`

2. **Tags with Groups** (recommended for organization): Tags organized into categories
    - Format: `t/GROUP.VALUE`
    - Example: `t/propertyType.HDB`, `t/location.Bishan`, `t/priceRange.500k-1M`

**Why use Tag Groups?**
- **Better organization**: Group related tags together (all property types, all locations, etc.)
- **Easier filtering**: Use `filter tg/propertyType` to find all contacts with any property type tag
- **Clearer contact management**: Instantly see which category each tag belongs to

**Example Contact with Tag Groups:**

`add n/John Tan p/91234567 e/john@example.com a/Blk 456 Bishan
r/Buyer
t/propertyType.HDB
t/location.Bishan
t/priceRange.500k-1M
t/priority`

In this example:
- `propertyType.HDB` - Tag with group (property type is HDB)
- `location.Bishan` - Tag with group (location is Bishan)
- `priceRange.500k-1M` - Tag with group (price range is 500k-1M)
- `priority` - Simple tag without group

---

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person (see [definition](#Person)) to the address book.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [r/ROLE]…​ [s/STATUS] [t/TAG]…`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Note:**
* No two persons can share the same `PHONE_NUMBER` or `EMAIL`.
* You can add multiple roles by repeating `r/ROLE` (e.g., `r/Buyer r/Investor`).
* Status must be either **Pending** or **Completed** (case-insensitive). Each person can have only one status.
* Status is optional. If not specified, the person will have no status.
* Tags can either be in the format:
    - `t/GROUP.VALUE` where both `GROUP` and `VALUE` are alphanumeric
    - a simple Tag `t/TAG` with alphanumeric text
</box>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe p/12345678 e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Betsy street, block 123 r/Seller s/Completed t/friend`
* `add n/Alex Tan p/87654321 e/alex@example.com a/Blk 456 r/Buyer r/Investor s/Pending`

### Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the address book.

Format: `list`

### Listing all Tag Groups : `tg`

Lists all tag groups you have created.

Format: `tg`

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes:**
* If no Tag Groups have been created yet, a message will inform you that no Tag Groups exist.
* This command helps you check which Tag Groups are available before assigning tags to contacts.
* Tag Groups persist across sessions and are automatically saved.

</box>

Examples:
* `tg` displays all existing Tag Groups such as `propertyType`, `location`, `price`, etc.


### Creating a Tag Group : `tg`

Creates a new Tag Group to organize your tags into categories.

Format: `tg GROUP_NAME`

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes:**
* `GROUP_NAME` must be **alphanumeric** (letters and numbers only, no spaces or special characters).
* Tag Group names are **case-sensitive** (e.g., `PropertyType` and `propertytype` are different).
* Duplicate Tag Group names are not allowed. If the Tag Group already exists, an error message will be shown.
* Once created, you can use the Tag Group when adding or editing contacts using the format `t/GROUP.VALUE`.

</box>

Examples:
* `tg propertyType` creates a Tag Group called `propertyType`.
* `tg location` creates a Tag Group called `location`.
* `tg priceRange` creates a Tag Group called `priceRange`.

**After creating a Tag Group**, you can assign tags within that group to contacts:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/john@example.com a/123 Street t/propertyType.HDB t/location.Bishan`
* `edit 1 t/propertyType.Condo t/priceRange.500k-1M`


### Deleting a Tag Group : `dtg`

Deletes an existing Tag Group.

Format: `dtg GROUP_NAME`

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Important:**

* To delete a Tag Group that's in use, you must first:
    1. Remove all tags using that group from your contacts (using the `edit` command), **OR**
    2. Delete the contacts that have tags in that group.
* Tag Group names are **case-sensitive**.

</box>

Examples:
* `dtg propertyType` deletes the `propertyType` Tag Group (only if not in use).
* `dtg location` deletes the `location` Tag Group (only if not in use).

**Error scenarios:**
* **Tag Group does not exist**: `The Tag Group propertyType does not exist.`
* **Tag Group in use**: `This Tag Group is currently in use and cannot be deleted. Please remove all tags associated with this group first.`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Use the `tg` command to list all your Tag Groups before attempting to delete one!

</box>


### Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [r/ROLE]…​ [s/STATUS] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`.
  - `INDEX` refers to the number shown beside each person in the displayed list.
  - `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values for `name`, `phone`, `email`, and `address` will be updated to the input values.
* When editing roles, the existing roles of the person will be removed (i.e., adding roles is not cumulative). You can specify multiple roles using multiple `r/` prefixes.
* Status must be either **Pending** or **Completed** (case-insensitive). Editing status will replace the existing status.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.

* You can remove all the person's roles by typing `r/` without specifying any role after it.
* You can remove a person's status by typing `s/` without specifying any status after it.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 1 s/Completed` Edits the status of the 1st person to `Completed`. If the person did not have a status, it will be added.

*  `edit 3 r/Buyer r/Landlord` Replaces all existing roles of the 3rd person with `Buyer` and `Landlord`.
*  `edit 4 s/` Removes the status from the 4th person.

### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`

</box>

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I check my Java version?<br>
**A**: To verify your Java version:
1. Open a terminal and enter `java -version`
2. You should see an output similar to:
   ```
   java version "17.0.x"  // or any higher version
   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.x+xx)
   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.x+xx, mixed mode, sharing)
   ```
3. **If the command is not recognised** or the version is less than 17: Follow this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallation.html) for installation.
4. After installation, type `java -version` to verify the correct version.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the new computer. Then, locate the new TrackerGuru home folder and replace its data folder with the data folder from your old computer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file (in the same directory as the JAR file) created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

## Glossary
### Java
Java is a programming platform used to run applications like TrackerGuru. TrackerGuru requires Java 17 or above.

### GUI
GUI Stands for Graphical User Interface. It is the visual part of TrackerGuru that you interact with using windows, buttons, and text fields and displays all your contacts.

### Person
A Person represents an individual contact entry in TrackerGuru. Each person stores key information used by property agents to manage and categorize clients.

**Fields:**
- **Name (`n/`)** – The full name of the contact.
- **Phone (`p/`)** – The contact’s phone number.
- **Email (`e/`)** – The contact’s email address.
- **Address (`a/`)** – The contact’s physical address.

**Optional Fields:**
- **Role (`r/`)** – See definition of [Role](#role).
- **Status (`s/`)** – See definition of [Status](#status)
- **Tag (`t/`)** – See definition of [Tag](#tag)

Each Person is uniquely identified by their **Phone** or **Email**.
Multiple optional fields (Role, Status, Tag) allow you to flexibly organize your contacts according to your workflow.

### Role
A Role categorises the type of contact in your address book. Each contact can have **multiple roles**.

Common roles for property agents include:
- **Buyer**: Someone looking to purchase property
- **Seller**: Someone looking to sell property
- **Landlord**: Property owner who rents out properties
- **Tenant**: Someone looking to rent property
- **Investor**: Someone interested in property investment

Roles are **case-sensitive** (e.g., "buyer", "Buyer", and "BUYER" are not treated the same). You can use any text as a role to fit your needs.

### Status
A Status tracks the progress or state of your interaction with a contact. Each contact can have **only one status** (or none).

**Valid status values:**
- **Pending**: Initial contact or ongoing negotiation
- **Completed**: Transaction successfully finished

Status values are **case-insensitive** (e.g., "pending", "Pending", and "PENDING" are all valid). Only these two values are allowed.

### Tag
A Tag is an optional label used to provide additional information about a contact.
A tag can also optionally contain a **Tag Group** (see [definition](#tag-group)), allowing it to be categorized under a specific group.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Note:**
* TrackerGuru must already contain the Tag Group for a tag to be assigned under said group.
  * Refer to [creating a Tag Group](#creating-a-tag-group--tg).
</box>

Common tags include:
- **VIP**: High-priority or important contact
- **Follow-up**: Contact that requires a follow-up
- **HotLead**: Contact with immediate potential

Tags are **case-sensitive** (e.g., "VIP" and "vip" are treated as different tags).

### Tag Group
A Tag Group organizes tags into broader categories for more structured classification.
It is a way to group related tags under a shared category.

**How it works:**
- Tag Groups are created using the `tg GROUP_NAME` command.
- Once created, you can assign tags within that group using the format `t/GROUP.VALUE`.
- Tag Groups allow you to categorize tags into logical categories.

Common Tag Groups include:
- **PropertyType**:
    - Example tags using this group: `t/PropertyType.Condo`, `t/PropertyType.Landed`, `t/PropertyType.HDB`
- **Location**:
    - Example tags using this group: `t/Location.Bishan`, `t/Location.Woodlands`, `t/Location.Sengkang`
- **Project**:
    - Example tags using this group: `t/Project.X`, `t/Project.Y`, `t/Project.Z`

Tag Groups are also **case-sensitive** (e.g., "Client" and "client" are treated differently), and are automatically saved and persist across sessions.
