**TrackerGuru is a desktop application meant for Property Agents to manage their contact details.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Property agents juggle scattered client and property data across multiple projects. TrackerGuru gives fast typists a lightweight, keyboard-first workspace to instantly add, search, and update contacts with no clutter, no clicks. It provides speed, structure, and focus that lets agents close deals faster.
* If you are interested in using TrackerGuru, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested in developing TrackerGuru, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
